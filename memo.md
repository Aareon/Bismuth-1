# Devs Memo


##Â Plugins 

Core plugins will need to be upgraded as well.

Are concerned :

- 035_socket_client
- 040_sendtx
- 500_hypernode

## Peers.txt

Now in datadir/live.
TODO: have a fixed github url to download from if they are missing or corrupt.


## HF

Rework difficulty function to get rid of decimals.
Small potential drift, so needs to be done at HF.
